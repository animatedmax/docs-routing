Zipkin is a tracing system that enables app developers to troubleshoot failures or latency issues. Zipkin provides the ability to trace requests and responses across distributed systems. See [Zipkin.io](http://zipkin.io/) for more information.

For more information about how the Gorouter works with HTTP headers and Zipkin tracing, see [HTTP Headers](../concepts/http-routing.html#http-headers).

To trace app requests and responses in Cloud Foundry, apps must also log Zipkin headers.   

After adding Zipkin HTTP headers to app logs, developers can use `cf logs myapp` to correlate the trace and span ids logged by the Gorouter with the trace ids logged by their app. To correlate trace ids for a request through multiple apps, each app must forward appropriate values for the headers with requests to other applications.
